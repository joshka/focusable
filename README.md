# Focusable crate

STATUS: Experimental - expect breaking changes.

This crate implements a generic focus handling approach that could be used in any application. This
was specifically crafted with the idea of providing a way to focus widgets in Ratatui.

This was inspired by [iced_focus](https://crates.io/crates/iced_focus) and
[rat-focus](https://crates.io/crates/rat-focus).
